## Flux UI Pro
- Flux UI is the official Livewire component library - It has full access to the free components and variants, as well as full access to the Pro components and variants.
- use `<flux:*>` components when available - they are the recommended way to build Livewire interfaces.
- **IMPORTANT**: Activate 'fluxui-development' when working with Flux UI components, including all free and pro components and variants.
