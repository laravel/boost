## Inertia

- Inertia.js components should be placed in the `resources/js/Pages` directory unless specified differently in the JS bundler (`vite.config.js`).
- Use `Inertia::render()` for server-side routing instead of traditional Blade views.
- Use the `search-docs` tool for accurate guidance on all things Inertia.
- Use/activate 'building-inertia-apps' whenever working with Inertia pages, forms, or navigation.
