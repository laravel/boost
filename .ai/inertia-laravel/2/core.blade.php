## Inertia v2
- Make use of all Inertia features from v1 and v2. Check the documentation before making any changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- New features: Deferred props, infinite scrolling (merging props + `WhenVisible`), lazy loading on scroll, polling, prefetching.
- When using deferred props, add a nice empty state with pulsing/animated skeleton.
