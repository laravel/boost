# Tailwind CSS Development

## When to Apply

Activate this skill when:
- Adding styles to components or pages
- Working with responsive design
- Implementing dark mode
- Extracting repeated patterns into components
- Debugging spacing or layout issues

## Core Patterns

- Use Tailwind CSS classes to style HTML; check and use existing Tailwind conventions within the project before writing your own.
- Offer to extract repeated patterns into components that match the project's conventions (i.e. Blade, JSX, Vue, etc.).
- Think through class placement, order, priority, and defaults. Remove redundant classes, add classes to parent or child carefully to limit repetition, and group elements logically.
- You can use the `search-docs` tool to get exact examples from the official documentation when needed.

## Tailwind CSS v4 Specific

- Always use Tailwind CSS v4; do not use the deprecated utilities.
- `corePlugins` is not supported in Tailwind v4.

### CSS-First Configuration

In Tailwind v4, configuration is CSS-first using the `@theme` directive — no separate `tailwind.config.js` file is needed:

```css
@theme {
  --color-brand: oklch(0.72 0.11 178);
}
```

### Import Syntax

In Tailwind v4, you import Tailwind using a regular CSS `@import` statement, not using the `@tailwind` directives used in v3:

```diff
- @tailwind base;
- @tailwind components;
- @tailwind utilities;
+ @import "tailwindcss";
```

### Replaced Utilities

Tailwind v4 removed deprecated utilities. Do not use the deprecated option; use the replacement. Opacity values are still numeric.

| Deprecated | Replacement |
|------------|-------------|
| bg-opacity-* | bg-black/* |
| text-opacity-* | text-black/* |
| border-opacity-* | border-black/* |
| divide-opacity-* | divide-black/* |
| ring-opacity-* | ring-black/* |
| placeholder-opacity-* | placeholder-black/* |
| flex-shrink-* | shrink-* |
| flex-grow-* | grow-* |
| overflow-ellipsis | text-ellipsis |
| decoration-slice | box-decoration-slice |
| decoration-clone | box-decoration-clone |

## Spacing

Use `gap` utilities instead of margins between siblings:

```html
<div class="flex gap-8">
    <div>Item 1</div>
    <div>Item 2</div>
</div>
```

## Dark Mode

If existing pages and components support dark mode, new pages and components must support dark mode in a similar way, typically using `dark:` variant:

```html
<div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
    Content adapts to color scheme
</div>
```

## Common Patterns

### Flexbox Layout
```html
<div class="flex items-center justify-between gap-4">
    <div>Left content</div>
    <div>Right content</div>
</div>
```

### Grid Layout
```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
    <div>Card 1</div>
    <div>Card 2</div>
    <div>Card 3</div>
</div>
```

## Common Pitfalls

- Using deprecated v3 utilities (bg-opacity-*, flex-shrink-*, etc.)
- Using `@tailwind` directives instead of `@import "tailwindcss"`
- Trying to use `tailwind.config.js` instead of CSS `@theme` directive
- Using margins for spacing between siblings instead of gap utilities
- Forgetting to add dark mode variants when the project uses dark mode
