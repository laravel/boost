## Tailwind CSS

- Always use existing Tailwind conventions; check project patterns before adding new ones.
- **CRITICAL**: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Tailwind CSS documentation and updated code examples. Never rely on training data.
- **IMPORTANT**: Activate `tailwindcss-development` every time you're working with tailwindcss/styling related task.
